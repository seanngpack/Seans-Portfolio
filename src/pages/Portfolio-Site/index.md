#Features
This is a fully-featured website with dynamic content. I am deploying the front-end with Netlify which rebuilds whenever I push the master repo. In the back I have Google analytics keeping track of visitor information. There is full SEO support and my site is ranked high on Google. I have a cool photo carousel system that works with touch gestures on every project page. I am also hosting my photos in the photography page.
