# Short summary

In short, the team had formulated a broad objective to separate wastes and had very little prior art to implement this goal. This project is really cool because we are iterating on existing technology and exploiting for an entirely use case than convention. After many brainstorming sessions (using techniques I picked up from Speck), we landed on an idea that seems almost like black magic: cyclonic separation. This technology can be seem in consumer products such as vacuums, but we had to scale it up and our own twist on the design to handle dense particles. We delegated CFD research to Ben Piperno and myself and received consultation and guidance from several experienced faculty members. Ben prepared many CFD studies which we used to guide hardware prototyping and development. I designed hardware which reflected closely to the geometries we were testing and utilized the results in a closed feedback loop to drive studies and discover new and interesting geometries. I also pioneered a novel active system where a secondary outlet near the taper of barrel opens momentarily to collect non-dense objects whirling around. Our team has currently paused development of the separator and handed off our research to future capstone groups. To read more about our project, check our the report below:
