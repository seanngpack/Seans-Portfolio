excerpt: "My six-month co-op at Speck led to new products released to market, and a patent under my name. I worked heavily with industrial designers and I'd like to think their design skills have rubbed off on me."

Co-oping (read: interning) at Speck was an amazing experience. The people there were really supportive, smart, driven, and cool. The pace of work at the product development team was very fast so I had to adapt quickly to changing needs and pushing development forward.

I worked directly with an [industrial designer](https://www.instagram.com/sketchypat/) in creating a new novel product from brainstorming up until manufacturing. We sketched ideas about what the product should do, what it should look like, how big it should be, and then we began creating prototypes using a 3D printer. I also ordered over a dozen items from our competitors to sacrifice them. We iterated on our designs and as we continued the development process, we gained more and more constraints from marketing and feedback from the brainstorms we held. We worked with the legal team to see if our product infringed on any patents. I prepared presentations and documents to send off to the legal team to make their lives easier. I also participated in naming sessions to figure out what the product would be called!

The first project I worked on at Speck was figuring out the best adhesive to use for the [GrabTab](https://www.speckproducts.com/accessories/grabtab/SPK-GTAB.html?ranMID=40350&ranEAID=a1LgFw09t88&ranSiteID=a1LgFw09t88-H235_oQ__a_QrXcD3mWy9g&utm_source=2126220&utm_medium=Linkshare&siteID=a1LgFw09t88-H235_oQ__a_QrXcD3mWy9g). I came into the project with very few constraints and desired criteria which meant I had to create and quantify them. Using previous knowledge/experience I had from my final project in my Measurements ME4505 class, I had a good idea of what consitutes a good adhesive for permanent use, but we needed something reusable. I worked directly with the main engineer behind this product and we came up a base list of desired qualities: strength, resuability, and minimal-residue. Then we talked to many vendors to source a large array of adhesives. We created test fixtures to consistently benchmark each adhesive in a controlled manner and narrowed down the list. Then I talked to many more vendors, and even some of them face-to-face in the office, looked through dozens of spec-sheets, ran through rounds of environment testing, and we found our grail adhesive. This adhesive was a great combination of specs that we wanted, plus more. It will be used for future projects and the documentation I created will be used to referance in future projects. This project required a lot of mechanical knowledge, iteration improvements and selection, and talking to a whole lot of people to get what I wanted.



I heavily used CAD and surface modeled everything. I created two phone cases for a Huawei and Google phone. Creating CAD for these phones was a labor-intensive process as I had to start from scratch and create a clean, organized, and logical tree of steps.  I worked with industrial designers to check my surfaces and curves ensuring they look aesthetic. I designed the inside surfaces with manufacturability in mind so I mitigated undercuts as much as possible in areas such as port holes. I constantly used curve analysis and surface analysis tools to double check continuity and cleanliness. I also used the draft analysis tool to make sure when the mold parts, nothing would get snagged and ruin the part. 

I worked on another CAD heavy project serving as the lead engineer. I drove engineering into the design to ensure the item provided a pleasant experience and to make sure it was manufacturable making costs. I added modifications to the product and got my name on a patent!
