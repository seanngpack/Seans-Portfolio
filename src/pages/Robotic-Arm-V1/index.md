# Design process
Here's a simple walkthrough of how I made this arm
1. Sketch design concepts
2. Write some geometric proofs and kinematic equations to dimension the arm; plotted kinematics on Matlab to drive dimensions
4. Decide that I'm ready to tackle this project
5. Ordered metal hardware from eBay and Aliexpress
6. Used the calculated dimensions and started making parts in Solidworks
7. 3D printed the parts and began assembling them with the metal hardware
8. Iterated the design several times until I was somewhat happy
9. Designed electronics schematics
10. Assemble electronics and wired them to arm
11. Result: Watch the video below!
